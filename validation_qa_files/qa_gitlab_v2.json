  {
    "question": "Why does Sourcegraph record interviews?",
    "answer": "We use BrightHire, an interview recording tool, to record all interviews. We do this because we believe that candidates should be assessed based on merit, not our memory (did you know that one hour after an interview, memory recall of the conversation declines to 44%?). BrightHire allows us to revisit key details, revise initial impressions, and replace implicit bias with explicit evidence. It brings structure and consistency to each interview and ensures that every candidate gets the opportunity they deserve. Have questions? To read our FAQ, click here.",

  {
    "question": "If I create or work on a personal project or invention outside working hours, will Sourcegraph own those under the contract?",
    "answer": "Sourcegraph will not own your personal projects or inventions made outside your working hours unless those projects or inventions are made in connection with, relate to, or result from Sourcegraph’s business or the work you perform for Sourcegraph.

  {
    "question": "In the List of Prior Inventions and Original Works of Authorship exhibit, do I have to list everything I’ve been working on or plan to work on (including side projects, and startups) or just projects related to Sourcegraph’s business?",
    "answer": "If there’s an overlap between your projects and Sourcegraph’s business (for example: code search, batch changes, code intelligence, code insights, etc.), go ahead and list them. Sourcegraph’s legal team can’t advise you what to list. But you can review the definitions outlined in the exhibit and decide if there’s anything you want to list. If you’re still not sure, you can consider consulting a lawyer."
