    "question": "Can I interview for multiple roles at the same time?",
    "answer": "In the event that you are interested in more than one opening, there is no limit on the number of roles you can apply for but keep in mind the following:\nYou will have to complete a full interview process for each role you apply to, so be mindful of the time commitment for each application you submit.\nDue to capacity, the recruiting team will only process 3 of your applications at a time based on which ones you decide to prioritize. Any other applications outside of the 3 will be processed after the prioritized roles’s interviews are completed.\nIn the effort to be as transparent as possible and avoid sending multiple competing GitLab offers, there will be an added step to the process after your final interview where you will discuss with your recruiter which role you’re interested in before any official offer documents can be sent.\nIf you already have interviewed with us, you can apply for a different role again, but please take note that there may be a cooldown period of 6 months or more if it’s a similar role, depending on the reason for not moving forward which is communicated by the recruiter.\nExample of dual Interview process outline\nApplication Process\nScreening Call\nAssessment (required for certain roles)\nTechnical Interview (required for certain roles)\nTeam Interviews\nDiscussion with your recruiter on which role you’re interested in\nReferences\n"

    "question": "I already passed the technical interview, will I need to repeat that stage if I reapply?",
    "answer": "If you are reapplying to a role in R&D and have already completed interviews following a technical interview, your technical feedback also remains valid for up to 6 months as long as you are applying to the same job family. The recruitment team will aim to run a reduced interview process in this scenario, however, if you are reapplying outside of the 6 month window or applying to a different job family, you will be required to restart the interview process with us again."
